## compared against

# mainRunName is a name that identifies the simulation being analyzed.

# preprocessedReferenceRunName is the name of a reference run that has been

[output]
## options related to writing out plots, intermediate cached data sets, logs,
## etc.

# directory where analysis should be written

# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names can be seen by running:
#   ./run_mpas_analysis --list
# This command also lists tags for each analysis.
# Shortcuts exist to generate (or not generate) several types of analysis.
# These include:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_<tag>' -- all analysis with a particular tag will be run
#   'all_<component>' -- all analyses from a given component (either 'ocean'
#                        or 'seaIce') will be run
#   'no_<task_name>' -- skip the given task
#   'no_<component>', 'no_<tag>' -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip all analysis
#                                   tasks from the given compoonent or with
#                                   the given tag.  Do
#                                      ./run_mpas_analysis --list
#                                   to list all task names and their tags
