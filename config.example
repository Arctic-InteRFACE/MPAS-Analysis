## This file contains the most common config options that a user might want
## to customize.  The values are the same as in mpas_analysis/config.default,
## the default config file, which has all possible configuration options.
## Usage:
##  1. Copy this file to a new name for a specific run (say config.myrun).
##  2. Modify any config options you want to change in your new config file.
##     At a minimum, you need to specify:
##       * [runs]/mainRunName -- A name for the run to be included plot titles
##                               and legends
##       * [input]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the simulation results
##                                  to analyze
##       * [input]/mpasMeshName -- The name of the MPAS ocean/sea ice mesh
##       * [output]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis results
##       * [oceanObservations]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis
##                                              ocean observations
##       * [seaIceObservations]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis
##                                               sea ice observations
##       * [regions]/regionMaskDirectory -- a directory containing MOC and
##                                          ice shelf region masks
##  3. run: ./run_mpas_analysis config.myrun.  This will read the configuraiton
##     first from config.default and then replace that configuraiton with any
##     changes from from config.myrun
##  4. If you want to run a subset of the analysis, you can either set the
##     generate option under [output] in your config file or use the
##     --generate flag on the command line.  See the comments for 'generate'
##     in the '[output]' section below for more details on this option.


[runs]
## options related to the run to be analyzed and reference runs to be
## compared against

# mainRunName is a name that identifies the simulation being analyzed.
mainRunName = runName

# preprocessedReferenceRunName is the name of a reference run that has been
# preprocessed to compare against (or None to turn off comparison).  Reference
# runs of this type would have preprocessed results because they were not
# performed with MPAS components (so they cannot be easily ingested by
# MPAS-Analysis)
preprocessedReferenceRunName = None

# config file for a reference run to which this run will be compared.  The
# analysis should have already been run to completion once with this config
# file, so that the relevant MPAS climatologies already exist and have been
# remapped to the comparison grid.  Leave this option commented out if no
# reference run is desired.
# referenceRunConfigFile = /path/to/config/file

[execute]
## options related to executing parallel tasks

# the number of parallel tasks (1 means tasks run in serial, the default)

# handle 12 simultaneous processes, one for each monthly climatology.

# By default, results are assumed to be directly in baseDirectory,
# i.e. <baseDirecory>/./

# names of ocean and sea ice meshes (e.g. oEC60to30, oQU240, oRRS30to10, etc.)

# files needed by the analysis are not found here, they will be generated and
# placed in the output mappingSubdirectory

[output]
## options related to writing out plots, intermediate cached data sets, logs,
## etc.

# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names can be seen by running:
#   ./run_mpas_analysis --list
# This command also lists tags for each analysis.
# Shortcuts exist to generate (or not generate) several types of analysis.
# These include:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_publicObs' -- all analyses for which observations are availabe on the
#                      public server (the default)
#   'all_<tag>' -- all analysis with a particular tag will be run
#   'all_<component>' -- all analyses from a given component (either 'ocean'
#                        or 'seaIce') will be run
#   'only_<component>', 'only_<tag>' -- all analysis from this component or
#                                       with this tag will be run, and all
#                                       analysis for other components or
#                                       without the tag will be skipped
#   'no_<task_name>' -- skip the given task
#   'no_<component>', 'no_<tag>' -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip all analysis
#                                   tasks from the given compoonent or with
#                                   the given tag.  Do

#                                   to list all task names and their tags
# an equivalent syntax can be used on the command line to override this
# option:

#         only_ocean,no_timeSeries,timeSeriesSST
